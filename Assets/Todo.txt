Description:
SfxO-1 is a gnarly LoFi sound generator made for the LTRO-1 fictional console.

A video game sound generator
A monkey drumming toy
A music composer ?

Disclaimer:
Although the Television Interface Adapter sound chip is awesome, I found it to be a bit too limiting for this project. 
For this reason I instead used 8-Bit audio at a nice and chunky bitrate.
